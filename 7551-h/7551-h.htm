<br />Become a fool by too much wisdom
<br />Being as impatient of commanding as of being commanded
<br />Being dead they were then by one day happier than he
<br />Being over-studious, we impair our health and spoil our humour
<br />Belief compared to the impression of a seal upon the soul
<br />Believing Heaven concerned at our ordinary actions
<br />Best part of a captain to know how to make use of occasions
<br />Best test of truth is the multitude of believers in a crowd
<br />Best virtue I have has in it some tincture of vice
<br />Better at speaking than writing&mdash;Motion and action animate word
<br />Better have none at all than to have them in so prodigious a number

<br />Burnt and roasted for opinions taken upon trust from others
<br />Business to-morrow
<br />But ill proves the honour and beauty of an action by its utility
<br />But it is not enough that our education does not spoil us
<br />By resenting the lie we acquit ourselves of the fault
<br />By suspecting them, have given them a title to do ill
<br />"By the gods," said he, "if I was not angry, I would execute you"
<br />By the misery of this life, aiming at bliss in another
<br />Caesar: he would be thought an excellent engineer to boot
<br />Caesar's choice of death: "the shortest"

<br />Cannot stand the liberty of a friend's advice

<br />Conclude the depth of my sense by its obscurity
<br />Concluding no beauty can be greater than what they see
<br />Condemn all violence in the education of a tender soul
<br />Condemn the opposite affirmation equally
<br />Condemnations have I seen more criminal than the crimes
<br />Condemning wine, because some people will be drunk
<br />Confession enervates reproach and disarms slander
<br />Confidence in another man's virtue
<br />Conscience makes us betray, accuse, and fight against ourselves
<br />Conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature
<br />Consent, and complacency in giving a man's self up to melancholy
<br />Consoles himself upon the utility and eternity of his writings
<br />Content: more easily found in want than in abundance
<br />Counterfeit condolings of pretenders
<br />Courageous in death, not because his soul is immortal&mdash;Socrates
<br />Courtesy and good manners is a very necessary study
<br />Crafty humility that springs from presumption
<br />Crates did worse, who threw himself into the liberty of poverty
<br />Cruelty is the very extreme of all vices
<br />Culling out of several books the sentences that best please me

<br />Dearness is a good sauce to meat
<br />Death can, whenever we please, cut short inconveniences
<br />Death conduces more to birth and augmentation than to loss
<br />Death discharges us of all our obligations
<br />Death has us every moment by the throat

<br />Deformity of the first cruelty makes me abhor all imitation
<br />Delivered into our own custody the keys of life
<br />Denying all solicitation, both of hand and mind
<br />Depend as much upon fortune as anything else we do
<br />Desire of riches is more sharpened by their use than by the need
<br />Desire of travel
<br />Desires, that still increase as they are fulfilled
<br />Detest in others the defects which are more manifest in us
<br />Did my discourses came only from my mouth or from my heart
<br />Did not approve all sorts of means to obtain a victory
<br />Die well&mdash;that is, patiently and tranquilly
<br />Difference betwixt memory and understanding

<br />Disgorge what we eat in the same condition it was swallowed
<br />Disguise, by their abridgments and at their own choice
<br />Dissentient and tumultuary drugs
<br />Diversity of medical arguments and opinions embraces all
<br />Diverting the opinions and conjectures of the people
<br />Do not much blame them for making their advantage of our folly
<br />Do not to pray that all things may go as we would have them
<br />Do not, nevertheless, always believe myself
<br />Do thine own work, and know thyself
<br />Doctors: more felicity and duration in their own lives?
<br />Doctrine much more intricate and fantastic than the thing itself
<br />Dost thou, then, old man, collect food for others' ears?
<br />Doubt whether those (old writings) we have be not the worst
<br />Doubtful ills plague us worst
<br />Downright and sincere obedience
<br />Drugs being in its own nature an enemy to our health
<br />Drunkeness a true and certain trial of every one's nature
<br />Dying appears to him a natural and indifferent accident
<br />Each amongst you has made somebody cuckold
<br />Eat your bread with the sauce of a more pleasing imagination
<br />Education
<br />Education ought to be carried on with a severe sweetness
<br />Effect and performance are not at all in our power
<br />Either tranquil life, or happy death
<br />Eloquence prejudices the subject it would advance
<br />Emperor Julian, surnamed the Apostate
<br />Endeavouring to be brief, I become obscure
<br />Engaged in the avenues of old age, being already past forty
<br />Enough to do to comfort myself, without having to console others
<br />Enslave our own contentment to the power of another?
<br />Enters lightly into a quarrel is apt to go as lightly out of it
<br />Entertain us with fables: astrologers and physicians
<br />Epicurus
<br />Establish this proposition by authority and huffing
<br />Evade this tormenting and unprofitable knowledge
<br />Even the very promises of physic are incredible in themselves
<br />Events are a very poor testimony of our worth and parts
<br />Every abridgment of a good book is a foolish abridgment
<br />Every day travels towards death; the last only arrives at it
<br />Every government has a god at the head of it
<br />Every man thinks himself sufficiently intelligent
<br />Every place of retirement requires a walk
<br />Everything has many faces and several aspects
<br />Examine, who is better learned, than who is more learned

<br />Excuse myself from knowing anything which enslaves me to others
<br />Executions rather whet than dull the edge of vices
<br />Expresses more contempt and condemnation than the other
<br />Extend their anger and hatred beyond the dispute in question
<br />Extremity of philosophy is hurtful
<br />Fabric goes forming and piling itself up from hand to hand
<br />Fame: an echo, a dream, nay, the shadow of a dream
<br />Fancy that others cannot believe otherwise than as he does
<br />Fantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting
<br />Far more easy and pleasant to follow than to lead
<br />Fathers conceal their affection from their children
<br />Fault not to discern how far a man's worth extends
<br />Fault will be theirs for having consulted me
<br />Fear and distrust invite and draw on offence
<br />Fear is more importunate and insupportable than death itself
<br />Fear of the fall more fevers me than the fall itself
<br />Fear to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be lamented?
<br />Fear was not that I should do ill, but that I should do nothing
<br />Fear: begets a terrible astonishment and confusion
<br />Feared, lest disgrace should make such delinquents desperate
<br />Feminine polity has a mysterious procedure
<br />Few men have been admired by their own domestics
<br />Few men have made a wife of a mistress, who have not repented it
<br />First informed who were to be the other guests
<br />First thing to be considered in love matters: a fitting time
<br />Flatterer in your old age or in your sickness
<br />Follies do not make me laugh, it is our wisdom which does
<br />Folly and absurdity are not to be cured by bare admonition
<br />Folly of gaping after future things
<br />Folly satisfied with itself than any reason can reasonably be
<br />Folly than to be moved and angry at the follies of the world
<br />Folly to hazard that upon the uncertainty of augmenting it
<br />Folly to put out their own light and shine by a borrowed lustre
<br />For fear of the laws and report of men
<br />For who ever thought he wanted sense?
<br />Fortune heaped up five or six such-like incidents
<br />Fortune rules in all things
<br />Fortune sometimes seems to delight in taking us at our word
<br />Fortune will still be mistress of events
<br />Fox, who found fault with what he could not obtain
<br />Friend, it is not now time to play with your nails
<br />Friend, the hook will not stick in such soft cheese
<br />Friendships that the law and natural obligation impose upon us
<br />Fruits of public commotion are seldom enjoyed
<br />Gain to change an ill condition for one that is uncertain
<br />Gave them new and more plausible names for their excuse
<br />Gentleman would play the fool to make a show of defence
<br />Gently to bear the inconstancy of a lover
<br />Gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue
<br />Give but the rind of my attention
<br />Give me time to recover my strength and health
<br />Give the ladies a cruel contempt of our natural furniture
<br />Give these young wenches the things they long for
<br />Give us history, more as they receive it than as they believe it
<br />Giving is an ambitious and authoritative quality
<br />Glory and curiosity are the scourges of the soul
<br />Go out of ourselves, because we know not how there to reside
<br />Good does not necessarily succeed evil; another evil may succeed
<br />Good to be certain and finite, and evil, infinite and uncertain
<br />Got up but an inch upon the shoulders of the last, but one
<br />Gradations above and below pleasure
<br />Gratify the gods and nature by massacre and murder
<br />Great presumption to be so fond of one's own opinions
<br />Greatest apprehensions, from things unseen, concealed
<br />Greatest talkers, for the most part, do nothing to purpose
<br />Greedy humour of new and unknown things
<br />Grief provokes itself
<br />Gross impostures of religions
<br />Guess at our meaning under general and doubtful terms
<br />Happen to do anything commendable, I attribute it to fortune
<br />Hard to resolve a man's judgment against the common opinions
<br />Haste trips up its own heels, fetters, and stops itself
<br />Hate all sorts of obligation and restraint
<br />Hate remedies that are more troublesome than the disease itself
<br />Have ever had a great respect for her I loved
<br />Have more wherewith to defray my journey, than I have way to go
<br />Have no other title left me to these things but by the ears
<br />Have you ever found any who have been dissatisfied with dying?
<br />Having too good an opinion of our own worth
<br />He cannot be good, seeing he is not evil even to the wicked
<br />He did not think mankind worthy of a wise man's concern
<br />He felt a pleasure and delight in so noble an action
<br />He judged other men by himself
<br />He may employ his passion, who can make no use of his reason
<br />He may well go a foot, they say, who leads his horse in his hand
<br />He must fool it a little who would not be deemed wholly a fool
<br />He should discern in himself, as well as in others
<br />He took himself along with him
<br />He who fears he shall suffer, already suffers what he fears
<br />He who is only a good man that men may know it
<br />He who lays the cloth is ever at the charge of the feast
<br />He who lives everywhere, lives nowhere
<br />He who provides for all, provides for nothing
<br />He who stops not the start will never be able to stop the course
<br />He will choose to be alone
<br />Headache should come before drunkenness
<br />Health depends upon the vanity and falsity of their promises
<br />Health is altered and corrupted by their frequent prescriptions
<br />Health to be worth purchasing by all the most painful cauteries
<br />Hearing a philosopher talk of military affairs
<br />Heat and stir up their imagination, and then we find fault
<br />Help: no other effect than that of lengthening my suffering
<br />High time to die when there is more ill than good in living
<br />Hoary head and rivilled face of ancient usage
<br />Hobbes said that if he Had been at college as long as others&mdash;
<br />Hold a stiff rein upon suspicion
<br />Home anxieties and a mind enslaved by wearing complaints
<br />Homer: The only words that have motion and action
<br />Honour of valour consists in fighting, not in subduing
<br />How infirm and decaying material this fabric of ours is
<br />How many and many times he has been mistaken in his own judgment
<br />How many more have died before they arrived at thy age
<br />How many several ways has death to surprise us?
<br />"How many things," said he, "I do not desire!"
<br />How many worthy men have we known to survive their reputation
<br />How much easier is it not to enter in than it is to get out
<br />How much it costs him to do no worse
<br />How much more insupportable and painful an immortal life
<br />How uncertain duration these accidental conveniences are
<br />Humble out of pride
<br />Husbands hate their wives only because they themselves do wrong
<br />I always find superfluity superfluous
<br />I am a little tenderly distrustful of things that I wish
<br />I am apt to dream that I dream
<br />I am disgusted with the world I frequent
<br />I am hard to be got out, but being once upon the road
<br />I am no longer in condition for any great change
<br />I am not to be cuffed into belief
<br />I am plain and heavy, and stick to the solid and the probable
<br />I am very glad to find the way beaten before me by others
<br />I am very willing to quit the government of my house
<br />I bequeath to Areteus the maintenance of my mother
<br />I can more hardly believe a man's constancy than any virtue
<br />I cannot well refuse to play with my dog
<br />I content myself with enjoying the world without bustle
<br />I dare not promise but that I may one day be so much a fool
<br />I do not consider what it is now, but what it was then
<br />I do not judge opinions by years
<br />I do not much lament the dead, and should envy them rather
<br />I do not say that 'tis well said, but well thought
<br />I do not willingly alight when I am once on horseback
<br />I enter into confidence with dying
<br />I ever justly feared to raise my head too high
<br />I every day hear fools say things that are not foolish
<br />I find myself here fettered by the laws of ceremony
<br />I find no quality so easy to counterfeit as devotion
<br />I for my part always went the plain way to work
<br />I grudge nothing but care and trouble
<br />I had much rather die than live upon charity
<br />I had rather be old a brief time, than be old before old age
<br />I hail and caress truth in what quarter soever I find it
<br />I hate all sorts of tyranny, both in word and deed
<br />I hate poverty equally with pain
<br />I have a great aversion from a novelty
<br />"I have done nothing to-day"&mdash;"What? have you not lived?"
<br />I have lived longer by this one day than I should have done
<br />I have no mind to die, but I have no objection to be dead
<br />I have not a wit supple enough to evade a sudden question
<br />I have nothing of my own that satisfies my judgment
<br />I honour those most to whom I show the least honour
<br />I lay no great stress upon my opinions; or of others
<br />I look upon death carelessly when I look upon it universally
<br />I love stout expressions amongst gentle men
<br />I love temperate and moderate natures
<br />I need not seek a fool from afar; I can laugh at myself
<br />I owe it rather to my fortune than my reason
<br />I receive but little advice, I also give but little
<br />I scorn to mend myself by halves
<br />I see no people so soon sick as those who take physic
<br />I speak truth, not so much as I would, but as much as I dare
<br />I take hold of, as little glorious and exemplary as you will
<br />I understand my men even by their silence and smiles
<br />I was always superstitiously afraid of giving offence
<br />I was too frightened to be ill
<br />"I wish you good health"&mdash;"No health to thee" replied the other
<br />I would as willingly be lucky as wise
<br />I would be rich of myself, and not by borrowing
<br />I write my book for few men and for few years
<br />Idleness is to me a very painful labour
<br />Idleness, the mother of corruption
<br />If a passion once prepossess and seize me, it carries me away
<br />If I am talking my best, whoever interrupts me, stops me
<br />If I stand in need of anger and inflammation, I borrow it
<br />If it be a delicious medicine, take it
<br />If it be the writer's wit or borrowed from some other
<br />If nature do not help a little, it is very hard
<br />If they can only be kind to us out of pity
<br />If they chop upon one truth, that carries a mighty report
<br />If they hear no noise, they think men sleep
<br />If to philosophise be, as 'tis defined, to doubt
<br />Ignorance does not offend me, but the foppery of it
<br />Impotencies that so unseasonably surprise the lover
<br />Ill luck is good for something
<br />Imagine the mighty will not abase themselves so much as to live
<br />Imitating other men's natures, thou layest aside thy own
<br />Immoderate either seeking or evading glory or reputation
<br />Impose them upon me as infallible
<br />Impostures: very strangeness lends them credit
<br />Improperly we call this voluntary dissolution, despair
<br />Impunity pass with us for justice

<br />So that I could have said no worse behind their backs
<br />So weak and languishing, as not to have even wishing left to him
<br />Socrates kept a confounded scolding wife
<br />Socrates: According to what a man can
<br />Soft, easy, and wholesome pillow is ignorance and incuriosity
<br />Solon said that eating was physic against the malady hunger
<br />Solon, that none can be said to be happy until he is dead
<br />some people rude, by being overcivil  in their courtesy
<br />Some wives covetous indeed, but very few that are good managers
<br />Sometimes the body first submits to age, sometimes the mind
<br />Souls that are regular and strong of themselves are rare
<br />Sparing and an husband of his knowledge
<br />Speak less of one's self than what one really is is folly
<br />Spectators can claim no interest in the honour and pleasure

<br />Stilpo lost wife, children, and goods
<br />Stilpo: thank God, nothing was lost of his
<br />Strangely suspect all this merchandise: medical care
<br />Strong memory is commonly coupled with infirm judgment
<br />Studied, when young, for ostentation, now for diversion
<br />Studies, to teach me to do, and not to write
<br />Study makes me sensible how much I have to learn
<br />Study of books is a languishing and feeble motion
<br />Study to declare what is justice, but never took care to do it
<br />Stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lies
<br />Stupidity and facility natural to the common people
<br />Style wherewith men establish religions and laws
<br />Subdividing these subtilties we teach men to increase their doubt
<br />Such a recipe as they will not take themselves
<br />Suffer my judgment to be made captive by prepossession
<br />Suffer those inconveniences which are not possibly to be avoided
<br />Sufficiently covered by their virtue without any other robe
<br />Suicide: a morsel that is to be swallowed without chewing
<br />Superstitiously to seek out in the stars the ancient causes
<br />Swell and puff up their souls, and their natural way of speaking
<br />Swim in troubled waters without fishing in them
<br />Take a pleasure in being uninterested in other men's affairs
<br />Take all things at the worst, and to resolve to bear that worst
<br />Take my last leave of every place I depart from
<br />Take two sorts of grist out of the same sack
<br />Taking things upon trust from vulgar opinion
<br />Taught to be afraid of professing our ignorance
<br />Taught to consider sleep as a resemblance of death
<br />Tearing a body limb from limb by racks and torments
<br />Testimony of the truth from minds prepossessed by custom?
<br />That he could neither read nor swim
<br />That looks a nice well-made shoe to you
<br />That we may live, we cease to live
<br />That which cowardice itself has chosen for its refuge
<br />The action is commendable, not the man
<br />The age we live in produces but very indifferent things
<br />The authors, with whom I converse
<br />The Babylonians carried their sick into the public square
<br />The best authors too much humble and discourage me
<br />The Bible: the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it
<br />The cause of truth ought to be the common cause
<br />The conduct of our lives is the true mirror of our doctrine
<br />The consequence of common examples
<br />The day of your birth is one day's advance towards the grave
<br />The deadest deaths are the best
<br />The event often justifies a very foolish conduct
<br />The faintness that surprises in the exercises of Venus
<br />The gods sell us all the goods they give us
<br />The good opinion of the vulgar is injurious
<br />The honour we receive from those that fear us is not honour
<br />The ignorant return from the combat full of joy and triumph
<br />The impulse of nature, which is a rough counsellor
<br />The last informed is better persuaded than the first
<br />The mean is best
<br />The mind grows costive and thick in growing old
<br />The most manifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness
<br />The most voluntary death is the finest
<br />The particular error first makes the public error
<br />The pedestal is no part of the statue
<br />The privilege of the mind to rescue itself from old age
<br />The reward of a thing well done is to have done it
<br />The satiety of living, inclines a man to desire to die
<br />The sick man has not to complain who has his cure in his sleeve
<br />The storm is only begot by a concurrence of angers
<br />The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear
<br />The very name Liberality sounds of Liberty
<br />The vice opposite to curiosity is negligence
<br />The virtue of the soul does not consist in flying high
<br />Their disguises and figures only serve to cosen fools
<br />Their labour is not to delivery, but about conception
<br />Their pictures are not here who were cast away
<br />Their souls seek repose in agitation
<br />There are defeats more triumphant than victories
<br />There are some upon whom their rich clothes weep
<br />There can be no pleasure to me without communication
<br />There is more trouble in keeping money than in getting it
<br />There is no allurement like modesty, if it be not rude
<br />There is no long, nor short, to things that are no more
<br />There is no merchant that always gains
<br />There is no reason that has not its contrary
<br />There is no recompense becomes virtue
<br />There is none of us who would not be worse than kings
<br />There is nothing I hate so much as driving a bargain
<br />There is nothing like alluring the appetite and affections
<br />There is nothing single and rare in respect of nature
<br />These sleepy, sluggish sort of men are often the most dangerous
<br />They (good women) are not by the dozen, as every one knows
<br />They begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living
<br />They better conquer us by flying
<br />They buy a cat in a sack
<br />They can neither lend nor give anything to one another
<br />They do not see my heart, they see but my countenance
<br />They err as much who too much forbear Venus
<br />They gently name them, so they patiently endure them (diseases)
<br />They have heard, they have seen, they have done so and so
<br />They have not one more invention left wherewith to amuse us
<br />They have not the courage to suffer themselves to be corrected
<br />They have yet touched nothing of that which is mine
<br />They juggle and trifle in all their discourses at our expense
<br />They must be very hard to please, if they are not contented
<br />They must become insensible and invisible to satisfy us
<br />They neither instruct us to think well nor to do well
<br />They never loved them till dead
<br />They who would fight custom with grammar are triflers
<br />Thing at which we all aim, even in virtue is pleasure
<br />Things grow familiar to men's minds by being often seen
<br />Things I say are better than those I write
<br />Things often appear greater to us at distance than near at hand
<br />Things seem greater by imagination than they are in effect
<br />Things that engage us elsewhere and separate us from ourselves
<br />Think myself no longer worth my own care
<br />Think of physic as much good or ill as any one would have me
<br />Thinking nothing done, if anything remained to be done
<br />Thinks nothing profitable that is not painful
<br />This decay of nature which renders him useless, burdensome
<br />This plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other
<br />Those immodest and debauched tricks and postures
<br />Those oppressed with sorrow sometimes surprised by a smile
<br />Those which we fear the least are, peradventure, most to be fear
<br />Those who can please and hug themselves in what they do
<br />Those within (marriage) despair of getting out
<br />Thou diest because thou art living
<br />Thou wilt not feel it long if thou feelest it too much
<br />Though I be engaged to one forme, I do not tie the world unto it
<br />Though nobody should read me, have I wasted time
<br />Threats of the day of judgment
<br />Thucydides: which was the better wrestler
<br />Thy own cowardice is the cause, if thou livest in pain
<br />'Tis all swine's flesh, varied by sauces
<br />'Tis an exact life that maintains itself in due order in private
<br />'Tis better to lean towards doubt than assurance&mdash;Augustine
<br />'Tis evil counsel that will admit no change
<br />'Tis far beyond not fearing death to taste and relish it
<br />'Tis for youth to subject itself to common opinions
<br />'Tis impossible to deal fairly with a fool
<br />'Tis in some sort a kind of dying to avoid the pain of living well
<br />'Tis more laudable to obey the bad than the good
<br />'Tis no matter; it may be of use to some others
<br />'Tis not the cause, but their interest, that inflames them
<br />'Tis not the number of men, but the number of good men
<br />'Tis said of Epimenides, that he always prophesied backward
<br />'Tis so I melt and steal away from myself
<br />'Tis the sharpness of our mind that gives the edge to our pains
<br />'Tis then no longer correction, but revenge
<br />'Tis there she talks plain French
<br />Titillation of ill-natured pleasure in seeing others suffer
<br />Title of barbarism to everything that is not familiar
<br />Titles being so dearly bought
<br />Titles of my chapters do not always comprehend the whole matter
<br />To be a slave, incessantly to be led by the nose by one's self
<br />To be, not to seem
<br />To condemn them as impossible, is by a temerarious presumption
<br />To contemn what we do not comprehend
<br />To die of old age is a death rare, extraordinary, and singular
<br />To do well where there was danger was the proper office
<br />To forbear doing is often as generous as to do
<br />To forbid us anything is to make us have a mind to't
<br />To fret and vex at folly, as I do, is folly itself
<br />To give a currency to his little pittance of learning
<br />To go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word
<br />To keep me from dying is not in your power
<br />To kill men, a clear and strong light is required
<br />To know by rote, is no knowledge
<br />To make little things appear great was his profession
<br />To make their private advantage at the public expense
<br />To smell, though well, is to stink
<br />To study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one's self to die
<br />To what friend dare you intrust your griefs
<br />To whom no one is ill who can be good?
<br />Tongue will grow too stiff to bend
<br />Too contemptible to be punished
<br />Torture: rather a trial of patience than of truth
<br />Totally brutified by an immoderate thirst after knowledge
<br />Transferring of money from the right owners to strangers
<br />Travel with not only a necessary, but a handsome equipage
<br />True liberty is to be able to do what a man will with himself
<br />Truly he, with a great effort will shortly say a mighty trifle
<br />Truth itself has not the privilege to be spoken at all times
<br />Truth, that for being older it is none the wiser
<br />Turks have alms and hospitals for beasts
<br />Turn up my eyes to heaven to return thanks, than to crave
<br />Tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we meet
<br />Twas a happy marriage betwixt a blind wife and a deaf husband
<br />Twenty people prating about him when he is at stool
<br />Two opinions alike, no more than two hairs
<br />Two principal guiding reins are reward and punishment
<br />Tyrannic sourness not to endure a form contrary to one's own
<br />Tyrannical authority physicians usurp over poor creatures
<br />Unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything
<br />Under fortune's favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace
<br />Universal judgments that I see so common, signify nothing
<br />Unjust judges of their actions, as they are of ours
<br />Unjust to exact from me what I do not owe
<br />Upon the precipice, 'tis no matter who gave you the push
<br />Use veils from us the true aspect of things
<br />Utility of living consists not in the length of days
<br />Valour has its bounds as well as other virtues
<br />Valour whetted and enraged by mischance
<br />Valour will cause a trembling in the limbs as well as fear
<br />Valuing the interest of discipline
<br />Vast distinction betwixt devotion and conscience
<br />Venture it upon his neighbour, if he will let him
<br />venture the making ourselves better without any danger
<br />Very idea we invent for their chastity is ridiculous
<br />Vice of confining their belief to their own capacity
<br />Vices will cling together, if a man have not a care
<br />Victorious envied the conquered
<br />Virtue and ambition, unfortunately, seldom lodge together
<br />Virtue is a pleasant and gay quality
<br />Virtue is much strengthened by combats
<br />Virtue refuses facility for a companion
<br />Viscid melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton age
<br />Voice and determination of the rabble, the mother of ignorance
<br />Vulgar reports and opinions that drive us on
<br />We are masters of nothing but the will
<br />We are not to judge of counsels by events
<br />We ask most when we bring least
<br />We believe we do not believe
<br />We can never be despised according to our full desert
<br />We cannot be bound beyond what we are able to perform
<br />We confess our ignorance in many things
<br />We consider our death as a very great thing
<br />We do not correct the man we hang; we correct others by him
<br />We do not easily accept the medicine we understand
<br />We do not go, we are driven
<br />We do not so much forsake vices as we change them
<br />We have lived enough for others
<br />We have more curiosity than capacity
<br />We have naturally a fear of pain, but not of death
<br />We have not the thousandth part of ancient writings
<br />We have taught the ladies to blush
<br />We much more aptly imagine an artisan upon his close-stool
<br />We must learn to suffer what we cannot evade
<br />We neither see far forward nor far backward
<br />We only labour to stuff the memory
<br />We ought to grant free passage to diseases
<br />We say a good marriage because no one says to the contrary
<br />We set too much value upon ourselves
<br />We still carry our fetters along with us
<br />We take other men's knowledge and opinions upon trust
<br />Weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy
<br />Weigh, as wise: men should, the burden of obligation
<br />Well, and what if it had been death itself?
<br />Were more ambitious of a great reputation than of a good one
<br />What a man says should be what he thinks
<br />What are become of all our brave philosophical precepts?
<br />What can they not do, what do they fear to do (for beauty)
<br />What can they suffer who do not fear to die?
<br />What did I say?  that I have?  no, Chremes, I had
<br />What he did by nature and accident, he cannot do by design
<br />What is more accidental than reputation?
<br />What may be done to-morrow, may be done to-day
<br />What more? they lie with their lovers learnedly
<br />What need have they of anything but to live beloved and honoured
<br />What sort of wine he liked the best: "That of another"
<br />What step ends the near and what step begins the remote
<br />What they ought to do when they come to be men
<br />What we have not seen, we are forced to receive from other hands
<br />What, shall so much knowledge be lost
<br />Whatever was not ordinary diet, was instead of a drug
<br />When I travel I have nothing to care for but myself
<br />When jealousy seizes these poor souls
<br />When their eyes give the lie to their tongue
<br />When time begins to wear things out of memory
<br />When we have got it, we want something else
<br />"When will this man be wise," said he, "if he is yet learning?"
<br />When you see me moved first, let me alone, right or wrong
<br />Where the lion's skin is too short
<br />Where their profit is, let them there have their pleasure too
<br />Wherever the mind is perplexed, it is in an entire disorder
<br />Whilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some great thing
<br />Whimpering is offensive to the living and vain to the dead
<br />Who by their fondness of some fine sounding word
<br />Who can  flee from himself
<br />Who discern no riches but in pomp and show
<br />Who does not boast of some rare recipe
<br />Who escapes being talked of at the same rate
<br />Who ever saw one physician approve of another's prescription
<br />Who has once been a very fool, will never after be very wise
<br />Who would weigh him without the honour and grandeur of his end
<br />Whoever expects punishment already suffers it
<br />Whoever will be cured of ignorance must confess it
<br />Whoever will call to mind the excess of his past anger
<br />Whosoever despises his own life, is always master
<br />Why do we not imitate the Roman architecture?
<br />Wide of the mark in judging of their own works
<br />Willingly give them leave to laugh after we are dead
<br />Willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever
<br />Wisdom has its excesses, and has no less need of moderation
<br />Wisdom is folly that does not accommodate itself to the common
<br />Wise man lives as long as he ought, not so long as he can
<br />Wise man never loses anything if he have himself
<br />Wise man to keep a curbing hand upon the impetus of friendship
<br />Wise may learn more of fools, than fools can of the wise
<br />Wise whose invested money is visible in beautiful villas
<br />Wiser who only know what is needful for them to know
<br />With being too well I am about to die
<br />Woman who goes to bed to a man, must put off her modesty
<br />Women who paint, pounce, and plaster up their ruins
<br />Wont to give others their life, and not to receive it
<br />World where loyalty of one's own children is unknown
<br />Worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind
<br />Would have every one in his party blind or a blockhead
<br />Would in this affair have a man a little play the servant
<br />Wrangling arrogance, wholly believing and trusting in itself
<br />Wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others
<br />Write what he knows, and as much as he knows, but no more
<br />Wrong the just side when they go about to assist it with fraud
<br />Yet at least for ambition's sake, let us reject ambition
<br />Yet do we find any end of the need of interpretating?
<br />You and companion are theatre enough to one another
<br />You have lost a good captain, to make of him a bad general
<br />You may indeed make me die an ill death
<br />You must first see us die
<br />You must let yourself down to those with whom you converse
<br />Young and old die upon the same terms
<br />Young are to make their preparations, the old to enjoy them

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
